    <br>Gong Fu Cha is a good way to enjoy some of the more expensive teas since it emphasizes <em>taste</em> and <em>aroma</em>. 
    <p>The main differences between the two are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The teapot is very small, often around ~100ml to 200ml</li>
        <li>The leaf-to-water ratio is very high</li>
        <li>The steep time is extremely short, sometimes starting from 5 seconds.</li>
      </ul>
      My preferred teas to drink using the Gong Fu Tea Method are:
      <ol>
        <li>Pu-erh</li>
        <li>Oolong</li>
        <li>Black Tea</li>
        <li>White Tea</li>
      </ol>

    <p>A great thing about Gong Fu Cha is that it allows you to concentrate on all of the nuances of tea. In a sense, it can become a great method of meditation. Take in the process, the timing, and the aromas and tastes to create a very relaxed atmosphere.</p>
