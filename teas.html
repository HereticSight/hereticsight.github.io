    <header><h1>Different Types of Tea</h1></header>
    
    <p>Tea comes in many varieties, but are often separated into a few categories.</p>
    
    <h4>Green Tea</h4>
    
    <p>Green teas are steamed or pan-fried shortly after they are picked. These teas are often light, with grassy flavors, which are reminiscent of where they come from.<br>
    The downside to green tea is that many tend to become bitter more easily if steeped for too long, or in water that is too hot.</p>
    
    <h4>White Tea</h4>
    
    <p>White teas are picked from the tiny bud and soft top leaves of the tea plant, so they are often produced in much lower yields than other types of tea. However, this is the reason that white teas taste very delicate. They are allowed to oxidize for a few hours after picking before they are dried.<br>
    Their flavor is lighter than Green Tea, but do still have similar downsides if steeped too long or in water that is too hot.</p>

    <h4>Oolong Tea</h4>

    <p>Oolong tea is partially oxidized, which puts them between green tea and black tea. The leaves are often twisted or rolled in order to promote the oxidation process. Oolong tea has a wide variation in oxidation levels, which causes some to take on the characteristics of green teas, while others would take on the characteristics of black tea. There are other Oolong teas that are roasted after the drying process, which causes them to take on some smokiness.<br>
    Oolong tea has a very fragrant, floral flavor to it and tends to be round.</p>

    <h4>Black Tea</h4>

    <p>Black tea is fully oxidized, and is often called "red" tea in China. The leaves are often torn or crushed to encourage oxidation. This usually makes for smaller leaves, but a more intense flavor.<br>

    Black tea is often dark and rich. The oxidation process will also give it an astringent flavor to it. </p>
    
    <h4>Pu-erh Tea</h4>

    <p>Pu-erh tea comes from the Yunnan province in China. This tea is begins as a green tea called maocha, which is packaged with some residual moisture and allowed to age for years.<br>

    The tea is known for its earthy flavors. The color can vary from light brown to as dark as coffee.</p>


    <h4>Herbal Tea</h4>

    <p>Tea made from herbs rather than the normal tea plant. Another name for this is Tisane, which literally means "Not Tea".</p>
